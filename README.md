### Wind-Turbines
I worked with "ReneWind" to build and tune classification models using sensor data on wind turbine generator failures. The goal was to identify failures in advance, enabling repairs before breakdowns and reducing maintenance costs.


#### Skills & Tools Covered:
* Up and downsampling
* Regularization
* Hyperparameter tuning
